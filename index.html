                            Hi, my name is Chloe Shaw. I am a Legal PA/Paralegal by day, and an aspiring Web Developer by night.
                            I have been interested in Web Development as a career for a number of years but have never had 
                            the confidence to pursue this dream, that is, until I finally worked up the courage to 
                            attend a 'She Codes' networking night, and after being inspired by hearing the stories 
                            of the mentors, I applied for the 5 month programming course.</br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Orginally, I am from England. I moved to Perth two years ago, 
                            with the intention of only being here for a year and planning to move back to the UK to 
                            continue with my legal studies. Clearly, that did not happen! I immediatley fell in love 
                            with everything that Australia has to offer including the weather, the 
                            lifestyle and beatiful beaches, one of my favorite beaches is pictured above. Three years ago,
                            I never thought I would be brave enough to take the plunge and move to the other side of the world, 
                            but I did it! Seeing how much my life has transformed by pursuing my dreams has encouraged me to take 
                            another leap and pursue Web Development. I am so excited to see where this new path will take me!

                            As mentioned above, I have been interest programming for a number of years. As a child, 
                            I had limited access to a computer and would spend the little time that I had creating 
                            webpages on Piczo by changing the layout with different images and text. 
                            As I got older, I would use resources such as Codeacademy and w3schools to teach myself 
                            to code. However, my lack of confidence would always get the better of me and I could 
                            never get past the basics. I am so lucky to have been choosen to take part in the 
                            'She Codes' course and have loved every minute of it! To learn to code in a such 
                            a supportive enviroment and with a network amazing women has helped me to overcome 
                            my biggest hurdels by giving me the knowledge and confidence required to pursure 
                            this as a career.

                            Moving to Australia has been a big change in lifestyle for me, mainly due to the change 
                            in weather. It is so much easier to get out and execersize in sunnier climates! Since
                            moving here I have taken up new activities such as Hiking, Cycling and Kayaking to help 
                            keep me fit and healthy and to enable me to explore the scenery and wildlife. I also try to 
                            eat healthier, particularly with how nice the fresh fruit and vegatables taste in Australia! 
                            Although I will have to admit it is not always easy with all of the lovely cafes and 
                            restaurants that Australia has to offer! I try to balance things out as much as I can. 
                            Australia is more health consious that the UK and I think that this has encouraged me to lead 
                            a healthier life. I have definately learned more about nutrition here in the last two years than
                            my entire life in the UK!

                            Family and friends are the most important thing to me and moving to the other side of the world 
                            was a very difficult decision for me. However, technology such as Skype, Facebook and WhatsApp 
                            has made it so much easier, and I am so grateful that this technology exisits. I feel less like
                            I am missing out and able to catch up with family and friends daily. I just wish I could teach Oscar 
                            (pictured above) how to use it! My Partner has family in Australia and we regularly catch up with them for 
                            family time and usually try new cafes, restraughts and bars. Perth is such a diverse city and I 
                            have met amazing people from a wide range of backgrounds, I always find it so facinating to learn 
                            about thier lives and thier cultures. It has really opened my eyes to the world and helped me adapt to 
                            Australian life.
